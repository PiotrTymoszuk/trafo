Transformation Toolset for Vectors, Matrices, Lists and Data Frames

The package provides tools for transformation and inter-conversion of vectors, matrices, lists and data frames, which expand the _tidyverse_ environment. Such extra tools include functions for translation of a variable using a dictionary table (generic function `exchange()`) and reduction of list into low-dimensional data structures (generic function `compress()`).

Additonal features making the life of a data scientist easier are e.g. a swiss army knife row binding function family, functions for setting row names and identification of individuals with complete record of consecutive data.
